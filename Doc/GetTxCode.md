# Getting local copy of the Tx code and documentation

There are two ways to get local copy:

1) Click on the SOURCE CODE tab, and then on the Download button

This downloads a zip file, and useful if you want to take a quick look

2) Using [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) as source control:

* Install [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
* launch the Git Shell, and choose one of the three repositories we keep in sync:
    *  **git clone https://git01.codeplex.com/tx**
    *  **git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Tx.git**
    *  **git clone https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Tx.git**

The documentation comes interleaved with the source code

* To view or edit the docs, please install either [MarkDownPad](http://www.markdownpad.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* To open the documents full screen, click Tools, Preview Markdown in Browser (F6)

We wish our documentation showed on CodePlex as good as Github. Specific issues are:

* [Support for relative links in MarkDown](https://codeplex.codeplex.com/workitem/27249)
* [Markdown layout is broken in source code browser](https://codeplex.codeplex.com/workitem/26990)
